This folder contains the code to generate the fluxomics data using EFlux algorithm. The generated fluxomcis data is stored in **./fluxes**.

The MATLAB file uses the model enclosed in this folder and the transcriptomic/proteomics data in the **../data** folder to run optimization using the glpk solver.
