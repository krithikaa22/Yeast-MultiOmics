**Section 1: data analysis**
This section will provide the code to generate the plots from the data analysis of the datasets.

**Section 2: fluxomcis**
This section will provide the code to generate fluxomics data (the data collection step of the workflow).

**Section 3: data splits**
This section will provide the code to split the yeast knockouts into low and high growth based on the measured growth rates. This is a preliminary step in the model development.

**Section 4: machine learning**
This section will provide the code to train and test classifiers and regressors (the model development step of the workflow).

**Section 5: feature selection**
This section will provide the code to select improtant features from the trained models (the interpretations step of the workflow).
